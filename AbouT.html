          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>My name is David I was born on in Oakland, California. My mom was born in Mexico city and so was my dad. That means I'm also Mexican. I've been living in Oakland my entire life; I have so many fun, and special memories here.
My favorite subject would have to be Math. I had high sores on the smi in middle school, so was am 2 year ahead of my grade. I am planning on taking driving classes so instead of my parents driving me places I will drive them places My hobbies are, listening to music playing video games, and playing outside with my cousins. I also like to play sports like capture the flag, soccer, and Foot ball. I was on my school's soccer team and I was enjoying it a lot.</p>
